The second can provide radar information up to 14 time a day as in the case of [Sentinel-1](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel-1). The C-Band radar manages to capture data in numerous conditions (e.g. darkness, rain, cloud, fog, etc.) and measures the energy reflected back called backscatter (Torres et al, 2012). Those data can later be analyzed and used to clear out potential collision between icebergs and ships. \n",

The new method provide a convenient way of getting rotational invariance over the data (Defferrard et al., 2017) and set up a flexible framework for structured pooling. \n",
