    "This remote sensing measurements can be performed either by planes or by satellites. The second can provide radar information up to 14 time a day as in the case of [Sentinel-1](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel-1). The C-Band radar manages to capture data in numerous conditions (e.g. darkness, rain, cloud, fog, etc.) and measures the energy reflected back called backscatter (Torres et al, 2012). Those data can later be analyzed and used to clear out potential collision between icebergs and ships. \n",
    "\n",
    "Building on the top of recent advances in the field of signal processing on graphs (Schuman et al., 2013) and deep learning on irregular domains (Bronstein et al., 2017), we investigate the performance of standard machine learning methods and the relevance of graph based convolutional neural networks to perform binary classification in this specific case (layered data). The new method provide a convenient way of getting rotational invariance over the data (Defferrard et al., 2017) and set up a flexible framework for structured pooling. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the pooling operations require adequate aggregation by coarsening the graph between layers, we experiment how this framework can be exploited through various processes: Graclus multilevel algorithm and algebraic multigrid techniques. We further extend by comparing on different cases: grid graph, knn graph and wrapped-knn graph. Finally, we show that one can take advantage of graphs to defined structured pooling.\n",
